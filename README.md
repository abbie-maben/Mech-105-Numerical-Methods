# Mech-105-Numerical-Methods

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB algorithms developed for various numerical methods. All agorithms were developed for MECH 105 in 2018 at Colorado State University. Below is a short description of each algorithm in this repository.
  ## False Position
  The false position method is numerical method used to approximate the roots of a function. This method utilizes bracketing to converge closer to the exact soution.
  ## LU Factor
  The LU Factor algorithm decomposes any square matrix into a lower triangular matrix and an upper trangular matrix by method of Gauss elimination with partial pivoting, with which the product of the lower triangular matrix and the upper triangular matrix is the original matrix.
  ## Simpson
  The Simpson's rule algorithm utilizes Newton-Cotes formulas to estimate the integral over a given interval. The algorithm computes the approximation with Newton's 1/3 rule and the Trapizoidal Rule.
