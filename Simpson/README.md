# Simpson.m
This function approximates the integral of points inputed in the form of vectors using the Simpson's 1/3 rule and the trapazoidal rule. The function uses the Simpson's 1/3 rule if the number of inputs is odd and if the number of inputs is even, the function will use the trapizoidal rule to approximate the integral over last two inputs.
## Inputs
+ x- Vector with the values of the independent variable
+ y- Vector with the values of the dependent variable with respect to x
## Outputs 
+ I- The approximated value of the integral
